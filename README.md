# ConsultationForum
A CLI Program For My Final Project Of The Course Data Structure
Made entirely from scratch with C++

The program was built according to these specification:

Descriptions : This app is used by patients and doctors. The data processed is consultation data between patients and doctors.
Specification:
- Users can register on the app as patients.
- Patients can consult by posting questions through the application.
- Doctors and patients can provide responses to questions from patients.
- Users who do not register can only view the consultation forum between patients and doctors.
- Questions need to be given certain tags to make searching and sorting easier.

There are also some general specification for this project such as:
- Projects are created using the C++ programming language
- The data structure form for a large assignment is a Multi Linked List with different types with levels of difficulty and grades that students can choose
- Using three different types of lists according to the plotting of the Class Lecturer.
- The data stored in both parent lists must be of the form type and have a minimum of 3 data where at least one of the data is an integer or real type.
- Data in child elements is at least in the form of pointers, you can add other data if you feel it is necessary
- 1 list with a list of relations
- 1 list without a relation list

The data structure that i used contains an M to N relations as follows:
